	        "I wish I was back at Harvard... watching a hospital drama.",
	        "This planet reminds me of a brilliant speech I once gave...",
	        "I am from a league of special minds. We were born to learn.",
	        "I would tell you a joke but there's a 87.9% possibility you wouldn't understand.",
	        "By the age of 2 I could speak 15 languages, including Esperanto and Pig Latin.",
	        "Nobody knows the answers to the universe, but I'm actually pretty close.",
	    },
	    Ensign = {
	    	"This planet terrifies me. In fact the whole sector does!",
	    	"The Doctors love to brag. It's best to just leave them to their devices.",
	    	"I sure hope the rest of the crew is okay...",
	    	"We are in search of rare crystals, but found monsters instead.",
	    	"Send the Ensign, they said. He'll be fun, they said...",
	    	"The Captain can be pretty adventurous, she watches Rick & Morty often.",
	    	"There is a parkour course on the Spaceship. Have you seen it?",
	    	"You can use your personal transporter to visit our ship. Press [TAB].",

	    Engineer = {
	    	"Make sure you're close to the enemy when using the shotgun. Shells decay faster than bullets.",
	    	"The pistol has a longer range, and does more damage per bullet. Keep this in mind when fighting ranged enemies.",
	    	"We can regenerate your health if you die.. but we can't respawn your ammo, so use it sparingly",
	    	"Enemies will respawn when you do. It's an unfortunate bug.. I mean special feature!",
	    	"Your current quest will be relayed to the spaceship and also to your personal HUD module.",
	    },
	    Captain = {
	    	"Do NOT touch the Boss Mage! It's an Insta-Death!!.",
	    	"They say the planet Titan is crawling with trolls.. they could sure use some help.",
	    	"The Doctors may come off rude, but they're intentions are good.",
	    	"Freddy's Milkshake Hut sells amazing milkshakes. Sadly they aren't even in this sector.",
	    	"Bishop can drive me up a wall sometimes.. but I do find his impeccable logic helpful.",
	    	"Scott and I met while at our University on IO, we plan to get married near the rings of Kryton.",
	    	"I wish I had a personal transporter. You just have to press [TAB] and away you go!",
