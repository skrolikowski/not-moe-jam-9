	        "I would tell you a joke but there's a 87.9% possibility you wouldn't understand.",
	        "By the age of 2 I could speak 15 languages, including Esperanto and Pig Latin.",

	    	"The Doctors love to brag. It's best to just leave them to their devices.",
	    	"I sure hope the rest of the crew is okay...",
	    	"We are in search of rare crystals, but found monsters instead.",

	    	"Make sure you're close to the enemy when using the shotgun. Shells decay faster than bullets.",
	    	"The pistol has a longer range, and does more damage per bullet. Keep this in mind when fighting ranged enemies.",
	    	"We can regenerate your health if you die.. but we can't respawn your ammo, so use it sparingly",
	    	"Enemies will respawn when you do. It's an unfortunate bug.. I mean special feature!",

	    	"They say the planet Titan is crawling with trolls.. they could sure use some help.",
	    	"The Doctors may come off rude, but they're intentions are good.",
